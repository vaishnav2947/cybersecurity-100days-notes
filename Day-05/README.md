### ``1. Broken Access Control`` :  a security flaw that allows unauthorized users to access, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to. This vulnerability is considered one of the most critical web application security risks.
### ``2. Cryptographic Failures`` :  where attackers often target sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal information, when you do not properly protect them. This is the root cause of sensitive data exposure.
